# Semai Lab DFIR: Simulating and Detecting an Attack - Scenario 2: Basic Vulnerability Exploitation

## Objective

This DFIR-based home lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting various types of cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and simulate scenarios from basic learning scenarios to imitating real world scenarios. In the previous part of the project, multiple open ports were found inside the domain controller, and in this part of the project, those ports will be exploited using vulnerabilities associated with those ports.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Ability to ingest and generate network logs.
- Enhanced knowledge of digital forensics and attack mitigation.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Type-2 Hypervisor for Virtual Machine Cluster setup
- Windows and Linux machines for various DFIR environments
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and forensic analysis.
- Automated background services for attack detection and mitigation.
