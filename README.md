## Semai Lab DFIR

Welcome to my Semai Lab DFIR home lab project page! This page is entirely dedicated to my DFIR home lab that has allowed me to gain practical knowledge of Digital Forensics and Incident Response as a whole, as well as explore certain areas of DFIR I've always been interested to try for myself! Every part of this project has taught me very interesting things about how a computer works, how certain tools function, and how to identify, detect, and mitigate various threat types, so feel free to check out any part of my project!
