# Semai Lab DFIR: Simulating and Detecting an Attack - Scenario 1: Password Spraying

## Objective

This DFIR-based home lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting various types of cyber attacks. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system and simulate scenarios from basic learning scenarios to imitating real world scenarios. In this part of the project, I will be simulating attack scenarios to gain a better understanding of log analysis.

### Skills Learned

- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Ability to ingest and generate network logs.
- Enhanced knowledge of digital forensics and attack mitigation.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- Type-2 Hypervisor for Virtual Machine Cluster setup
- Windows and Linux machines for various DFIR environments
- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and forensic analysis.
- Automated background services for attack detection and mitigation.
